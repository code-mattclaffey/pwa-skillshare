					<h1>Background Sync</h1>

					<p>Now that we are on a roll let's try out some background syncing & push notifications. Sometimes the user just wants to do a quick task such as ordering pizza where they will take their phone out of pocket, order some takeaway as they go home and then puts the phone away.</p>

					<p>Oh wait! As the user puts their phone away they lose a connection which means their order may not have gone through. We have all been in that situation where we have a faulty connection as we are on the go doing our day to day tasks & it can be really annoying!</p>

					<p>Background sync is perfect for this because it will wait until we have a connection again and then it will send that data to the endpoint it is meant to be going to. If the user performs a task where it has to go back to there server the request can get stored in the background so it updates when the user gets connection again. <a href="https://dbwriteups.wordpress.com/2015/11/16/service-workers-part-4-background-sync/" target="_blank">Service Workers – Part 4 – Background Sync</a></p>
