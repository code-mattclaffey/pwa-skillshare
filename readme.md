## Emoji Helpers

I don't expect you to write every single line of code by yourself so I have added some emojis in the code which give you hints in what to do next. This was inspired by the epic react dev as it is a great idea.

📝 - Reading material
🚧 - Area of the code where I have added some boilerplate but needs more work to get the job done.
👷 - Bob the builder will give you the tools (hints) to what code needs to be written 
💩 - Code smells that we need to remove
📱 - When its time to test it in the browser
