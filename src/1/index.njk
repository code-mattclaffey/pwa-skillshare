<h1>Getting those lighthouse checks ticked off</h1>

<p>Lighthouse is a really useful tool that allows us to see how good our application is running.
They have a really good PWA checker that allows us to see what we need to do to make our application PWA friendly.</p>

<p>Let's warm ourselves into it by getting the easy stuff boxed off. To find lighthouse, open devtools and select it from the panel.
If its not there, there is a
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="norefferer nofollow">üìù chrome extension</a>
that allows you to test from the browsers ui.</p>

<div data-section-name="test-manifest"  aria-hidden="false">
  <h2>Adding meta data to our layout</h2>

  <p>In the base.njk layout file we need to add a few meta tags. Our fellow friend <abbr title="Bob">üë∑ </abbr>
  will assist you getting the right tags in place.</p>

  <h2>Building your own manifest.json file</h2>

  <p>
    Next we need to start telling the browser information about our application. To do this we need a manifest that gives the browser
    options which will be use when the user installs the application to their homescreen.

  <p>Amazing! So now you should see a lot more green in the lighthouse scores for the pwa. Let's now get it green across the board. Let's go offline...</p>
