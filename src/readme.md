# Building the basic PWA ... with some fun bits ;)

This section covers over the following:

- Building a web manifest
- Caching files
- Offline page
- Background syncing (click events)
- Push notifications (not from server)

To get started run `npm run start-l1` and then spin up [Localhost](http//localhost:8080). When localhost is spun up make sure you clear your application data on that port just in case there is any living service-workers from other projects that have been installed on that port.
